# Hackathon-Project

We are Freshman Virginia Tech Students participating in our first hackathon. The goal of our project is to help with woman's empowerment, especially in fields of S.T.E.M. where adanced programming tools are needed to assit with robotics work. To aid in this process, we made a program that permits the user to enter a series of joint angles and see the result of their work on a separate GUI window.
